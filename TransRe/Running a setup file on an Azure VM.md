Running a `setup.exe` file on an Azure VM using Ansible requires a few steps. You need to ensure that the `setup.exe` is accessible to the VM, either by uploading it directly to the VM or by making it available through a shared network path. Once the `setup.exe` is available on the VM, you can use the `win_command` or `win_shell` module to run the executable.

Here's a step-by-step guide to running a `setup.exe` file on an Azure Windows VM using Ansible.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have set up an Ansible control node that can communicate with the Azure VM using WinRM.
- You need the `pywinrm` package installed to communicate with Windows VMs using WinRM. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install pywinrm
  ```

### Step 1: Configure WinRM on the Windows VM

To manage your Windows VM using Ansible, you need to enable and configure WinRM on the VM. You can do this manually or via an automation script in Azure. Here's a basic script to enable WinRM on the VM:

```powershell
winrm quickconfig -q
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
```

### Step 2: Create an Ansible Playbook

Below is an example Ansible playbook that uploads a `setup.exe` file to the Azure Windows VM and runs it.

#### Playbook to Upload and Execute `setup.exe` on Windows VM:

```yaml
---
- name: Run setup.exe on Azure Windows VM
  hosts: azure_windows  # Use the group name from your inventory
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    
    # Step 1: Upload setup.exe to the VM
    - name: Copy setup.exe to the Windows VM
      ansible.windows.win_copy:
        src: /path/to/local/setup.exe  # Local path to the setup.exe
        dest: C:\Users\Public\setup.exe  # Destination path on the VM

    # Step 2: Run setup.exe using win_command
    - name: Run setup.exe on the Windows VM
      ansible.windows.win_command: |
        C:\Users\Public\setup.exe /silent  # Run setup.exe silently (add any needed parameters)
      args:
        chdir: C:\Users\Public\  # Set the directory where the command will run
      register: result

    # Step 3: Check the output for debugging
    - name: Display setup.exe output
      debug:
        var: result.stdout_lines
```

### Explanation of the Playbook:

1. **Copy the `setup.exe` File to the VM**: 
   - The `win_copy` module is used to copy the `setup.exe` file from the Ansible control node to the Windows VM's directory (in this case, `C:\Users\Public\`).

2. **Run the `setup.exe` File**:
   - The `win_command` module is used to run the `setup.exe` with appropriate options. In this example, the `/silent` option is used for unattended installation. You can modify the options according to the installation requirements.

3. **Debug the Output**:
   - The output from the installation process is captured in the `result` variable and displayed using the `debug` task.

### Step 3: Inventory Configuration

Ensure you have a correct inventory configuration that allows Ansible to communicate with the Windows VM over WinRM. Hereâ€™s an example inventory file (`inventory.yml`):

```yaml
azure_windows:
  hosts:
    azure_vm:
      ansible_host: <azure_vm_public_ip>  # Public IP of the Azure VM
      ansible_user: <vm_username>         # Windows VM username
      ansible_password: <vm_password>     # Windows VM password
      ansible_port: 5986                  # WinRM HTTPS port
      ansible_connection: winrm
      ansible_winrm_transport: basic
      ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
```

### Step 4: Run the Playbook

Once your playbook is ready and your inventory file is properly configured, run the playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml run_setup_on_windows.yml
```

### Step 5: Verify Installation

After running the playbook, you can verify whether the `setup.exe` executed successfully by checking logs or directly logging into the Azure VM.

### Optional: Handling Interactive Installers

If the installer is interactive and requires user input, it's best to run it with silent or unattended installation parameters (e.g., `/silent`, `/quiet`, or `/unattended`). Check the documentation of the installer for specific options to run it without manual intervention.

### Additional Notes:

- If the installer requires dependencies or additional configuration, ensure they are in place before running the installer.
- You can also monitor installation logs (if any) using the `win_get_url` module to fetch log files back to your control node for review.

This setup allows you to upload and run the `setup.exe` installer on an Azure Windows VM, automating the installation process using Ansible.
